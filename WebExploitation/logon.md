### Description:
Find the flag being held on this server to get ahead of the competition.

### 1. Knowledge
#### 1.1 Cookie
Why do we need cookie?
- The server wants to track users and determine the identity of a person.

_Example_: If you are a student, you will be provided with a student ID card by your university. The student ID card can be likened to a **cookie** that is assigned to you. (and you keep this student ID card - similar to how a cookie is stored on the **client**).

#### 2. Solution
I entered a random username and password, and the response:

I noticed that the server sent me a cookie, but it was sent as "admin". I tried changing the value to "True" and successfully obtained the flag.
