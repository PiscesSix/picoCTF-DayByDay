# substitution0
## AUTHOR: WILL HONG

### Description:
A message has come in but it seems to be all scrambled. Luckily it seems to have the key at the beginning. Can you crack this substitution cipher?

Download the message [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/152/message.txt).

## 1. Solution:

Using this tool: [guballa.de](https://www.guballa.de/substitution-solver)

I'm trying to find the correct characters in the latest line: ```Bif mwdy qa: xqcpCBM```,  I think it's ```The flag is: picoCTF``` :> and I found some characters.
