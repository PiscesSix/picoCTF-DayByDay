### Description:
We found a leak of a blackmarket website's login credentials. Can you find the password of the user ```cultiris``` and successfully decrypt it?
Download the leak [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/151/leak.tar).

The first user in ```usernames.txt``` corresponds to the first password in ```passwords.txt```. The second user corresponds to the second password, and so on.

## 1. Solution:

If ypu have username is ```cultiris``` $\to$ you will find that the password is ```cvpbPGS{P7e1S_54I35_71Z3}```. I noticed that it look like ROT, so i using [kt.gy](https://kt.gy/tools.html#conv/) to decode.
